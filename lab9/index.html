            <h2>Use of Array.sort() and Array.filter()</h2>
            
            <h3>Array.sort() (Used in Plot 1)</h3>
            <p>
                I used Array.sort() in my first plot, which is an adaptation of my Lab 8 bubble chart.
                The sort function is used on the dataset right before drawing the circles.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Effect:</strong> I sorted the data based on studyTime in <strong>descending order</strong> (from largest to smallest). 
                This ensures that the largest circles (representing the most study time) are drawn first, 
                and the smallest circles are drawn last (on top). This prevents small data points from
                being hidden behind larger ones, which makes the visualization much clearer. 
                This was very useful for legibility.
            </p>

            <h3>Array.filter() (Used in Plot 2)</h3>
            <p>
                I used Array.filter() in my second plot to explore a specific part of my original 
                hypothesis from my data PDF[cite: 2]. My original hypothesis was about comparing 
                "spaced repetition" and "massed practice".
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Effect:</strong> The filter function creates a new array that <strong>only</strong> includes
                data points where the method is either "spaced repetition" or "massed practice".
                It filters out "elaborative encoding" and "mnemonic imagery".
                This was extremely useful because it decluttered the visualization and allowed me to
                do a direct comparison between the two methods I was most interested in, 
                making the chart much more focused.
