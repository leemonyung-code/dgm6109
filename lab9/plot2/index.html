        <h1>Plot 2: Study Time vs. Delayed Recall (Filtered)</h1>
        
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <strong>Question:</strong> When comparing *only* "Spaced Repetition" and "Massed Practice", does study time have a clear effect on delayed recall?
            <br>
            <strong>Hypothesis (from Lab 7):</strong> As study time increases, delayed recall score increases.
        </p>

            <h3>Reason Why This is One of My Best Scatterplots</h3>
            <p>
                This visualization is a direct and focused exploration of my original hypothesis.
                It uses Array.filter() to remove the "noise" from the "elaborative encoding" and "mnemonic imagery" methods.
                This allows for a much cleaner, direct comparison between the two methods I was most interested in.
            </p>
            <p>
                By plotting Study Time (X-axis) against Delayed Recall (Y-axis) and using Color (the 3rd property) to distinguish the two methods, I can easily look for two separate clusters or trends. This helps answer a more specific question: "Does the effect of study time "depend" on the method?"
                This plot is more focused than Plot 1 and does a better job of investigating a specific, comparative question.
