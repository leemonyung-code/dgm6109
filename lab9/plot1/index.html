        <h1>Plot 1: Confidence vs. Delayed Recall by Method and Time</h1>
        
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <strong>Hypothesis:</strong> As my self-rated confidence (0-10) increases, my delayed recall score increases.
            <br>
            <strong>In addition:</strong> Study time (circle size) and study method (color) are shown to explore other potential correlations.

            <h3>Reason Why This is One of My Best Scatterplots</h3>
            <p>
                This visualization effectively displays four different data properties (confidence, recall score, study time, and method) in a single, clear chart. It directly tests my primary hypothesis by plotting confidence on the X-axis and recall on the Y-axis. 
            </p>
            <p>
                By using color for 'method' and circle size for 'studyTime', it allows for a deeper analysis of secondary factors. For example, we can look to see if one study method (a specific color) clusters in the high-confidence, high-recall area.
            </p>
            <p>
                Technically, this plot also correctly uses Array.sort() to draw the largest circles first. This prevents smaller data points from being hidden behind larger ones and significantly improves the chart's legibility.
