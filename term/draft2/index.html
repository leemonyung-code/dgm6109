                <h3>Hypothesis & Question</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Question:</strong> How does different study method and the duration of a study time affect my performance to recall vocabs 24 hours later?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Hypothesis:</strong> I hypothesize that there will be a positive correlation between study time and delayed recall score. However, I also predict that active study methods (like Mnemonic Imagery) will get higher retention rates than passive methods (like Massed Practice), regardless of the time spent.

                <h3>Data Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    The data presented here was collected over a period of 4 weeks (October 1st to October 28th, 2025). 
                    Each data point represents a daily study session.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Collection Frequency:</strong> Once per day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Key Variables:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Study Time:</strong> Duration of the session in minutes (X-axis).</li>
                            <li><strong>Delayed Recall Score:</strong> A test score out of 15 points, taken 24 hours after studying (Y-axis).</li>
                            <li><strong>Method:</strong> The technique used, represented by color.</li>
                            <li><strong>Self-Rated Confidence:</strong> A score (7-8.5) representing how confident I felt, represented by <strong>circle size</strong> (larger circles = higher confidence).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> The dataset includes 28 consecutive days of records, satisfying the requirement for 4+ weeks of data.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Based on the visualization, there appears to be a general positive correlation between study time and delayed recall score. 
                    However, the method of study plays a significant role. "Massed Practice" data points (orange) tend to cluster lower on the Y-axis. 
                    Additionally, larger circles (higher confidence) often correlate with higher Recall Scores, suggesting that my self-assessment of learning quality is generally accurate.
                    "Mnemonic Imagery" (red) shows both high scores and larger circle sizes, indicating high effectiveness and confidence.
