                <h3>Hypothesis & Question</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Question:</strong> How does different study method and the duration of a study time affect my performance to recall vocabs 24 hours later?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Hypothesis:</strong> I hypothesize that there will be a positive correlation between study time and delayed recall score. However, I also predict that active study methods (like Mnemonic Imagery) will get higher retention rates than passive methods (like Massed Practice), regardless of the time spent.

                <h3>Data Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    The data presented here was collected over a period of <strong>10 weeks (October 1st to December 10th, 2025)</strong>. 
                    Each data point represents a daily study session.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Collection Frequency:</strong> Once per day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Key Variables:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Study Time:</strong> Duration of the session in minutes (X-axis).</li>
                            <li><strong>Delayed Recall Score:</strong> A test score out of 15 points, taken 24 hours after studying (Y-axis).</li>
                            <li><strong>Method:</strong> The technique used, represented by color (4 categories).</li>
                            <li><strong>Self-Rated Confidence:</strong> A score (7-9.0) representing how confident I felt, represented by <strong>circle size</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> The dataset includes consistent daily records until the end of the term, satisfying the requirement for long-term data collection.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Based on the visualization of the full term's data, my hypothesis is strongly supported. 
                    <strong>"Mnemonic Imagery" (Yellow)</strong> consistently yields the highest Recall Scores (clustering at the top-left and top-center), indicating high efficiency even with moderate study time. 
                    Conversely, <strong>"Massed Practice" (Blue)</strong> points cluster at the bottom, showing low retention rates (often below 60%) regardless of how long I studied.
                    This suggests that the <em>method</em> of study is a more significant predictor of performance than the raw <em>duration</em> (Study Time).
