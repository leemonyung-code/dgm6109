                <h3>Research Question & Hypothesis</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Question:</strong> How does the amount of time spent studying (in minutes) affect the Delayed Recall Score (measured 24 hours later)? Does this relationship vary depending on the study method used?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Hypothesis:</strong> As study time increases, the delayed recall score will generally increase. I also hypothesize that "Spaced Repetition" and "Mnemonic Imagery" will show higher efficiency (better scores for the same time) compared to "Massed Practice".
                </p>

                <h3>Data Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    The data presented here was collected over a period of 4 weeks (October 1st to October 28th, 2025). 
                    Each data point represents a daily study session.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Collection Frequency:</strong> Once per day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Key Variables:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Study Time:</strong> Duration of the session in minutes (X-axis).</li>
                            <li><strong>Delayed Recall Score:</strong> A test score out of 15 points, taken 24 hours after studying (Y-axis).</li>
                            <li><strong>Method:</strong> The technique used (Spaced Repetition, Massed Practice, Elaborative Encoding, Mnemonic Imagery), represented by color.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> The dataset includes 28 consecutive days of records, satisfying the requirement for 4+ weeks of data.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Based on the visualization, there appears to be a general positive correlation between study time and delayed recall score, supporting the initial hypothesis. However, the method of study plays a significant role. "Massed Practice" data points (orange) tend to cluster lower on the Y-axis despite varying study times, suggesting it is less effective. Conversely, "Mnemonic Imagery" (red) and "Elaborative Encoding" (green) show consistently higher recall scores. This suggests that while time is a factor, the <em>quality</em> or <em>technique</em> of study is perhaps a stronger predictor of retention than time alone.
